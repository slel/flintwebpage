<h3>Brief project history</h3>

<p>FLINT has been developed since 2007 by a large number of people. Initially
the library was started by David Harvey and William Hart. Later maintenance
of the library was taken over solely by William Hart,
who remained the project leader until 2022.
</p>

<p>FLINT 2.0 was a clean rewrite from scratch
done around 2010 by William Hart, Sebastian Pancratz and Fredrik Johansson.
Eventually, the 2.x series greatly expanded the scope of FLINT
with new features such as finite fields (implemented by Mike Hansen) and
multivariate polynomials (Daniel Schultz), just to mention two examples.
</p>

<p>
FLINT 3.0, due for release in 2023, merges three spin-off projects
which were previously maintained as separate
libraries: Arb and Calcium (started by Fredrik Johansson in 2012 and 2020),
and Antic (started by William Hart in 2013).
The author list below includes people who contributed to those
projects.

<li>In addition, Michael Abshoff, William Stein and Robert Bradshaw have
contributed to the build system of FLINT.</li>

<li>Michael Abshoff deserves special recognition for his help in
resolving a number of difficult build issues which came to light as FLINT was
incorporated into Sage and for bringing numerous bugs to the attention of the
FLINT maintainers. Michael regularly checked FLINT for memory leaks and
corruption, which directly led to numerous issues being identified early!
He also helped with setting up various pieces of infrastructure for the FLINT
project.</li>

<li>Numerous people have contributed to wrapping FLINT in Sage and
debugging, including
Mike Hansen, Jean-Pierre Flori, Burcin Erocal, Robert Bradshaw,
Martin Albrecht, Sebastian Pancratz, Fredrik Johansson, Jeroen Demeyer,
Clemens Heuberger and Leif Leonhardy,
amongst others.</li>

<li>Some code (notably longlong.h and clz_tab.c) has been used from
the GMP library, whose main author is Torbjorn Granlund.
FLINT also includes code from the MPFR library developed by
Guillaume Hanrot, Vincent Lefèvre, Patrick Pélissier,
Philippe Théveny, Paul Zimmermann and others.
